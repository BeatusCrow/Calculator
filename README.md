This is just a repository where I'm trying to understand the basics of working with JavaFX in practice. As a project to understand the basics, I chose a calculator... Simple and useful.

At the same time, I will try to write a class for quick calculation of a
mathematical expression written in a string, because in the course of the project, I lacked this.
