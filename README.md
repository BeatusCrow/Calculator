# Calculator

This is just a repository where I'm trying to understand the basics of working with JavaFX in practice. As a project to understand the basics, I chose a calculator... Simple and useful.

At the same time, I will try to write a class to quickly calculate
a mathematical expression written in a string, because during the project I lacked this, and connecting js ... is too boring.

P.S. At the moment, the program is fully written and does not require additions. Mb after some time I will decide to improve the visual component by adding a css document. If someone needs to look at the implementation of a class to count a mathematical expression written in a string, then here -> https://github.com/BeatusCrow/Calculator/blob/main/Calculator/src/sample/Mathematics.java
